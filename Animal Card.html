			<p id="funfact">Cheetahs are the original household feline companion.For thousands of years, cheetahs have made grand “house” pets. Historically, emperors, kings, and pharaohs kept them as a sign of wealth. Their history with humans can be dated as far back as 32000BCE. Because cheetahs could not easily breed in captivity, individuals were taken from the wild.Although they were never technically domesticated, the cheetah is comparable to today’s domestic cat in many ways.

			<p>The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration that would leave most automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds. Wild cheetahs are thought to be able to reach speeds of nearly 70 miles an hour—although they can only sustain that speed for about 30 seconds. These cats are nimble at high speeds, able to make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of prey.</p>
